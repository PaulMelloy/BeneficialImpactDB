# BeneficialImpactDB
**Under construction**
Public version-controlled database of pesticide impacts on beneficial arthropods

## Aim  
Provide an open-source repository for crowdsourcing knowledge and experimental results on pesticide impacts to beneficial arthropods in plant production systems.  

## How to contribute  
### Discuss
Create an 'Issue' to discuss projects, goals, specific species targets  

### Add pesticide impact  
Fork or branch the `dev` (development) branch and make changes. 
Initiate a pull request to the `dev` branch to have your changes reviewed by others before the changes are accepted.

## Retaining Database integrity  
### Version control for traceability  
Use git version control to track additions and changes to the beneficial impact database. This will attribute changes and additions to authors with a timestamp.

### Feature branches for alternate version
Anyone can fork the branches and make their own version on a feature branch.
However:  
 - The `main` branch is reserved as a version with accurate data verified impact scores and is peer-reviewed by repository contributors and the wider community through discussion in issues and pull requests
 - The `dev` branch is reserved as a version with accurate data verified impact scores and is peer-reviewed by repository contributors, but not yet discussed with the wider community through discussion in issues and pull requests.
